# Ghostice ApplicationDriver

It's a WinForms (Wpf to come) .Net GUI Test Automation Toolchain.

It is currently capable of supporting any control regardless of source, be it bespoke or commercial third party control.

It does not rely on any 'testpackages' required by the commercial toolsets.

Its design is based up the very popular WebDriver/Selenium 2 model with a Server and Client API implemented over a Json Wire Protocol.

It includes a factory pattern model for producing coded window models or WOMS based on annotation (.net attributes).


Why this project got started because....

Well why should GUI automation be so very slow and so expensive that a return on investment is so very hard to produce let alone maintain?

If you include the tooling costs it's nearly test negative equity when you calculate the ROI!

Off Soap Box ;)


If youâ€™re interested I suggest taking a look at the unit tests, the E2E tests show the whole lifecycle.
