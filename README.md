# Ghostice ApplicationDriver

It's a WinForms (Wpf to come) .Net GUI Test Automation Toolchain.

It is currently capable of supporting any control regardless of source, be it bespoke or commercial third party control.

It does not rely on any 'testpackages' required by the commercial toolsets.

Its design is based up the very popular WebDriver/Selenium 2 model with a Server and Client Api implemented as a Json Wire Protocol.

It includes a factory pattern model for producing coded window models or WOMS based on annotation (.net attributes).

This project got started because; well why should GUI automation be so very slow and expensive?

If youâ€™re interested I suggest taking a look at the unit tests, the E2E tests show the whole lifecycle.

More to come :)
